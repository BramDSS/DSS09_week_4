# Build mtcars model






## Introduction
This app makes it easy tot test different Generalised Linear Models on the mtcars dataset.
 

## Using the app
The approach is as follows. The user can select the variables to be used in the sidebar panel on the left.  
In the main panel (right part on the screen) on several tabs the results of the fitted model are shown, as well as a short summary of the (remaining) dataset. 
 
An intercept will always be part of the model.


## Some background
During the final project of the linear regression course (number 7 in the Data science specialization of Coursera), several models had to be developed and compared. This app would have made that process a little easier. 

Since the question in the regression course was on the dependecy of miles per gallon on transmission, the dependent variable will always be miles per gallon, and the initial (only) covariate is transmission type.
