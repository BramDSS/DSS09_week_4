## Overview

For the course 9, "Developing Data Products", which is part of the Data science specializtion on Coursera, a web app was created with the Shiny package. The idea behind it stems from course 7 (Regression Models) in which a model had to be build for the (dependent) variable `mpg` of the `mtcars` dataset. The key question then was whether type of transmission (variable `am`, automatic of manual) is a factor that influences `mpg`. At that time, it meant just typing another model definition and evaluating the result over and over again.

But genoeg blabla for now
